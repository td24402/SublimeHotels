# SublimeHotels
Using SQL the objective of this project is to create a database to better keep track of sales transactions and customer profiles of Sublime Hotel, as well as keep track of damage that occurred to the hotel. The hotel can use our database to manage and analyze sales transactions to better marketing and fund allocation. The database can be used to help make relationship-driven marketing plans that boost consumer responsiveness and revenue. When using our database, accessing, storing, and maintaining any sort of data will be easy and simple. Our database will also be eliminating redundant data and protecting the data from unauthorized systems. Data access will also be easy for the user.
